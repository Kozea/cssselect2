cssselect2: CSS selectors for Python ElementTree
================================================

cssselect2 is a straightforward implementation of `CSS3 Selectors`_ for
`ElementTree`_-compatible documents (including cElementTree, lxml_, etc.)
Unlike cssselect_, it does not translate selectors to XPath_
and therefore does not have all the correctness corner cases
that are hard or impossible to fix in cssselect.
